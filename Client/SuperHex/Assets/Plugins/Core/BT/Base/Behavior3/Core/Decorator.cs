     * Decorator is the base class for all decorator nodes. Thus, if you want to 
     * create new custom decorator nodes, you need to inherit from this class. 
     * 
     * When creating decorator nodes, you will need to propagate the tick signal to
     * the child node manually, just like the composite nodes. To do that, override
     * the `tick` method and call the `_execute` method on the child node. For 
     * instance, take a look at how the Inverter node inherit this class and how it
     * call its children:
     *
     *
     *     // Inherit from Decorator, using the util function Class.
     *     var Inverter = b3.Class(b3.Decorator);
     *     var p = Inverter.prototype;
     *     
     *         // Remember to set the name of the node. 
     *         p.name = 'Inverter';
     *     
     *         // Override the tick function
     *         p.tick = function(tick) {
     *             if (!this.child) {
     *                 return b3.ERROR;
     *             }
     *     
     *             // Propagate the tick
     *             var status = this.child._execute(tick);
     *     
     *             if (status == b3.SUCCESS)
     *                 status = b3.FAILURE;
     *             else if (status == b3.FAILURE)
     *                 status = b3.SUCCESS;
     *     
     *             return status;
     *         };
     *

     * @extends BaseNode
